To start using Lumx Protocol, simply make a request to our [create a project](/api-reference/projects/create-a-project) endpoint, passing your project's name. You will receive an API key to start making requests to our sandbox environment right away.

When you're ready to start building in a production environment, please send a message on [our community](https://discord.gg/RvHymsBDHD) for further instructions.
