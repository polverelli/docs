Registering a webhook allows your application to receive real-time updates about specific events occurring within the Lumx Protocol.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a webhook using the Lumx dashboard.

### Create a webhook

To create a webhook, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Webhooks Page**:

   - Log in to your Lumx account.
   - From the left sidebar, select Settings.
   - Under the Settings tab, select Webhooks.

2. **Open the Create Webhook Dialog**:

   - Click the Create webhook button.

3. **Fill in the Webhook Details**:
   - In the Create webhook dialog box, enter your endpoint URL in the Webhook field.
   - Under Called when, select the events for which you want the webhook to be triggered:
     - **Mint a token**
     - **Transfer a token**
     - **Invoke a custom transaction**
   - Click the Create button to save your webhook.

### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how you might fill out the webhook details:

- **Webhook**: `https://your-webhook-url.com`
- **Called when**:
  - Enable **Mint a token** if you want the webhook to be triggered when a token is minted.
  - Enable **Transfer a token** if you want the webhook to be triggered when a token is transferred.
  - Enable **Invoke a custom transaction** if you want the webhook to be triggered for custom transactions.

### Verify the Webhook

To ensure the webhook is set up correctly, you can verify its details by following these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Webhooks Page**:

   - Go to the Settings tab.
   - Select Webhooks to see the list of configured webhooks.

2. **Check the Details**:
   - Verify that your newly created webhook appears in the list with the correct endpoint and selected events.
