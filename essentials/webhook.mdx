Our Webhook System provides real-time updates on the status of transactions, ensuring seamless integration with your application. This system sends HTTP POST requests to a specified URL whenever a transaction is completed, allowing you to handle the results programmatically.

### How It Works

Once a transaction is completed, our system sends an update to the registered webhook URL. The payload sent in these updates contains comprehensive information about the transaction, allowing you to track and respond to the final status effectively.

### Webhook Payload

The payload delivered to your webhook URL includes the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
    "walletId": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
    "status": "success",
    "transactionHash": "<string>",
    "blockExplorerUrl": "<string>",
    "result": {},
    "request": {
      "contractId": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
      "quantity": 123
    },
    "type": "mint",
    "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "completedAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
  }
]
```

Webhooks enable you to monitor events in your Lumx environment, allowing applications to automatically receive updates about these events.
