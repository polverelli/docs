# Understanding Extensions

Extensions are powerful modules that expand the core capabilities of the Lumx Protocol by integrating third-party services and providers. They act as bridges between the protocol's core functionality and external services, enabling you to build more sophisticated solutions.

## How Extensions Work

1. **Connecting to Core Modules**: Extensions interface directly with the protocol's core functionality
2. **Adding New Capabilities**: Each extension brings its own set of features and APIs
3. **Maintaining Standards**: All extensions follow the protocol's security and integration standards
4. **Providing Flexibility**: Choose and combine extensions based on your needs
